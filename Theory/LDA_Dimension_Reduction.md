## Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

1. LDA helps in identifying and finding patterns to reduce the dimensions of the dataset such that the separation between
the various classes in maximum.
2. More theory can be studied from [LDA](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_lda.html)
3. Ways to compute eigen values, eigen vectors - [Eigen Value Decomposition](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dellaert/ftp/svd-note.pdf)

### Key Points

1. LDA is very similar to PCA, but if you need to reduce the dimensions and also keep good
separation between the classes then LDA would be good.
2. Draw back of LDA is that it works only for supervised classification tasks only.
