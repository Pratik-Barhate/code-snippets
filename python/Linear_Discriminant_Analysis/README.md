### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

1. LDA helps in identifying and finding patterns to reduce the dimensions of the dataset such that the separation between
the various classes in maximum.
2. More theory can be studied from [LDA](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_lda.html)
3. Ways to compute eigen values, eigen vectors - [Eigen Value Decomposition](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dellaert/ftp/svd-note.pdf)

#### Libraries and Python version

1. python - v3.6.3
2. pandas - v0.21.0
3. numpy - v1.13.3
4. sklearn - v0.19.1

#### NOTE

1. LDA is very similar to PCA, but if you need to reduce the dimensions and also keep good separation between the classes.
